# CS50x_2023
 CS50x Harvard files from the 2023 course.

## About my work
All of my work demonstrated here is very similar to the work in [old CS50 file](https://github.com/KennedySovine/CS50_2020) and that is because it is basically the same work except updated for the new course. I never ended up finishing the 2020 course because I couldn't get the description for my final project long enough. Now though, I finished and got my certificate for the course.
